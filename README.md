# Stormworks-Workshop-Mods-Copier

# **Currently ONLY for Windows!**

This program has quite a specific use case, if you have Stormorks (the steam game) bought and you have obtained a version with all DLC's unlocked, then by using this program you can copy mods that you download through Steam into the Stormworks folder. Essentially you subscribe to mods like you regularly would, and the program puts them into the game files for you!

## There are two versions available:
-Regular installer (installs the program in Program Files and makes a desktop shortcut)

-Portable (double click to run, ***Caution: creates a config file in the directory where it's placed!***)

## Running for the first time
When running for the first time you have to run it with administrator privileges to allow it generate a config file. You will be asked to pick 3 folder paths:
1. The path where Steam downloads your workshop mods (usually: C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/workshop/content/573090)
2. The path to the "preset_vehicles_advanced" folder in your Stormworks folder (usually: Stormworks\rom\data\preset_vehicles_advanced)
3. The path to the "missions" folder in your Stormworks folder (usually: Stormworks\rom\data\missions)
